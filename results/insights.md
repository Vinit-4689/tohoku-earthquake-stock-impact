# 📊 Detailed Insights: Tōhoku Earthquake Impact on Stock Markets

---

## 🔬 1. Volatility Spike

- **Nikkei 225:**
  - Volatility (measured by standard deviation of daily returns) increased **nearly 3x** after the Tōhoku earthquake.
  - This is a typical behavior for markets facing sudden uncertainty or systemic risk.
  - Investor panic and rapid repricing of assets amplified short-term volatility.

- **S&P 500:**
  - Minimal change in volatility.
  - Demonstrates that U.S. markets, while aware of global events, exhibited *resilience* to a regional crisis.

### Interpretation:
> Local disasters create **localized volatility shocks** unless they have deep global financial ties.

---

## 🔢 2. Mean Daily Returns Behavior

- **Nikkei 225:**
  - Pre-Earthquake: Slightly positive mean returns, indicating healthy market sentiment.
  - Post-Earthquake: Mean returns turned significantly negative, reflecting immediate economic fear and loss anticipation.

- **S&P 500:**
  - Surprisingly, mean returns became slightly positive after the earthquake.
  - Likely due to capital inflows into "safe haven" assets like U.S. equities.

### Interpretation:
> Disasters can trigger **capital flight** from affected regions to perceived safer markets.

## 🔇 3. Daily Behavior Timeline

- **March 11, 2011:**
  - Immediate mild negative reaction (markets had limited time to react as it occurred late in the trading day).

- **March 14, 2011:**
  - Nikkei 225 plunged ~6% in a single trading session.

- **Following Weeks:**
  - Persistent high volatility and chaotic price movements in Nikkei 225.
  - S&P 500 quickly stabilized within a week.

### Interpretation:
> Immediate post-event periods often show **knee-jerk reactions**, followed by periods of **gradual rationalization**.

## 🔄 4. Statistical Significance

- Despite the visible change in volatility and return behavior, **T-Tests** on mean returns yielded **non-significant p-values**:
  - **Nikkei 225 P-value:** ~0.70
  - **S&P 500 P-value:** ~0.39

### Why?
- Extremely high variance right after the event overshadowed the mean shift.
- Short evaluation window (few months).

### Interpretation:
> Not every visible disruption results in **statistically meaningful** shifts. Markets are noisy, and large sample sizes are crucial.

## 📅 Overall Timeline Flow

| Date            | Event | Impact |
|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Feb 1, 2011     | Data window begins | Stable pre-event markets |
| Mar 11, 2011    | Tōhoku Earthquake | Volatility spike, Nikkei crash |
| Mar 14-21, 2011 | Chaos in Nikkei | Sharp down days, erratic recovery |

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- **Volatility is the first response** to a disaster, not mean shift.
- **Global diversification** can protect portfolios from regional shocks.
- **Psychological factors** (fear, uncertainty) temporarily overwhelm rational valuation.
- **Recovery dynamics** are slower in the affected region compared to unaffected regions.
