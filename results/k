# 📈 Detailed Insights: Impact of the Tōhoku Earthquake on Stock Markets

---

## 🧠 Objective

We explored how a catastrophic natural disaster — the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake — affected stock markets, focusing on **Japan's Nikkei 225** and **the US S&P 500**.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we compared **market returns** and **volatility** before and after the earthquake, visualized the patterns, and statistically tested for significant changes.

## 📈 Step-by-Step EDA Insights

### 1. **Volatility (Risk) Analysis**

- **Method**: Calculated the **standard deviation of daily returns** before and after the earthquake.
  
- **Findings**:
  - **Nikkei 225**: Volatility surged dramatically after the earthquake (from ~0.0105 to ~0.0275).
  - **S&P 500**: Volatility slightly decreased (from ~0.0087 to ~0.0071).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The earthquake introduced **extreme uncertainty and risk** in the Japanese market.
  - The S&P 500 remained **mostly insulated**, highlighting how **local disasters have localized effects**.

### 2. **Mean Returns Analysis**

- **Method**: Analyzed **average daily returns** pre- and post-earthquake.

- **Findings**:
  - **Nikkei 225**: Mean returns dropped sharply into the negative after the earthquake.
  - **S&P 500**: Mean returns slightly increased after the earthquake.

- **Interpretation**:

  - **S&P 500**: Only **minor disturbances** around the same date.

- **Interpretation**:
  - The Nikkei 225 saw **short-term panic and recovery**.
  - US markets had **limited ripple effects**.

### 4. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing (T-Test)**

- **Method**: Performed **independent T-tests** on daily returns before vs. after the earthquake.

- **Findings**:
  - **Nikkei 225**:
    - T-statistic ≈ 0.39, P-value ≈ 0.70
    - ➔ No significant difference at 95% confidence.
  - **S&P 500**:
    - T-statistic ≈ -0.87, P-value ≈ 0.39
    - ➔ No significant difference at 95% confidence.

- **Interpretation**:
  - **Volatility increased** even though **mean returns didn't shift statistically**.
  - Highlights: **Practical risk matters even without statistical significance**.

---

## 🔥 Final Conclusions

- **Risk Matters More Than Average Returns**  
  After disasters, volatility surges even if average returns are stable.

- **Localized Impact**  
  Domestic markets (Nikkei 225) react much more sharply to local disasters than global indices (S&P 500).

- **Investor Behavior Changes**  
  Behavioral factors like fear and uncertainty increase volatility.

- **Tōhoku Earthquake = Market Stress Test**  
  Critical for understanding **risk management** and preparing for **black swan events**.

## 🧹 Future Work Ideas

- Expand analysis to currencies (JPY/USD).
- Perform sector-specific analysis (e.g., utilities vs. construction in Nikkei 225).
- Compare more global indices (e.g., Euro Stoxx 50, Hang Seng).
